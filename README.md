# Semantic Experiments

The following repository contains a variety of experiments I conducted on the output of various sentence transformers. The goal was to gain an intuition on how language is represented by these models so much of the work here is fairly undirected. 

I learnt a lot from these projects, however I don't think I'll ever make a codebase like this again. The over reliance on Jupyter notebooks make understanding what I wrote very difficult.
