# Semantic Experiments

The following repository contains a variety of experiments I conducted on the output of various sentence transformers. The goal was to gain an intuition on how language is represented by these models so much of the work here is fairly undirected. 

I never intended for this project to be for any purpose in particular so I didn't bother with readability or maintability. This was a mistake as it made iterating on this project difficult.
