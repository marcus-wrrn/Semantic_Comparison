    "## GPT-4 Description of Topic 0 for positive and negative sentence pairs using a random sample of 50 sentences as given context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positive\n",
    "All of the sentences provided describe roles, responsibilities, skills, or expertise that someone has or is gaining in a specific field or position. Each sentence provides insight into what the individual does (roles/responsibilities), what they know or are learning (skills/knowledge/expertise), or the impact of their work. The specific fields and roles vary widely, including customer service, data management, construction, healthcare, software development, and more. However, they are all linked by this common theme of describing professional responsibilities or abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic 0: roles and responsibilities, with an emphases on skills, knowledge, expertise or impact of their work\n",
    "\n",
    "### Negative\n",
    "All of these sentences discuss some form of challenge, stress, or difficulty related to a particular job or role. These challenges could be physical (like demanding physical labor or long hours), emotional (like dealing with difficult customers or situations), or systemic (such as strict regulations, bureaucracy, or additional responsibilities). The sentences articulate the complexities and hardships faced by individuals in various professional or personal roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic 0: challenges, stress or difficulty related to the role\n",
    "\n",
    "## Human understanding of additional negative clusters\n",
    "Topic 1, appears to discuss a lack of fulfillment and/or satisfation working in a role. Sentences appear to follow very similar structure. All remaining topics demonstrate domain specific expertise. For example Topic 2 is medical orientated and discusses a lack of qualification to perform surgeries or give medical advice to people. Topic 3 is structured similarily except it is focused on the lack of qualification to give legal and financial advice"
